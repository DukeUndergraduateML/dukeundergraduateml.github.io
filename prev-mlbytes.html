                        <li>Despite the public health emphasis on population-level cancer screening in recent decades, adherence remains lower than desired, and cancer is often detected too late for successful treatment. In this talk, we will present Freenome’s multiomics platform that detects key biological signals from blood. The platform integrates assays for cell-free DNA, methylation, and proteins with advanced computational biology and machine learning techniques to understand additive signatures for early cancer detection. Furthermore, we will present biological insights revealed by latent representations from factor analysis and convolutional neural networks of genomic and proteomic data. These methods can be applied to other cancer types to learn biologically meaningful latent representations and to shed light on immune processes involved in cancer biology.</li>

                        <li><i>Ahmadieh Family Grand Hall (Gross Hall 330), 4.30pm-5.30pm</i></li>
                        <li>Machine learning seems to be everywhere, across industries and affecting many aspects of daily living. Aside from the practical applications of machine learning in business, new solutions are being put into action to help environmental causes that can improve the lives of people and the planet. Leslie De Jesus will explain how one such solution is being created by Wovenware for the Puerto Rico Science, Technology, & Research Trust, which is working to help prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, such as Zika and Dengue Fever, in Puerto Rico and eventually around the world, by automating the identification and classification of various species of mosquitoes. The end goal is to use AI to streamline the process through which researchers can uncover insights and correlate specific mosquito populations to environmental conditions, helping them identify and isolate mosquitoes that are resistant to FDA-approved insecticides.</li>

                        <li>Search engines are used daily across the world. Given a search term, how can relevant results be returned? This talk discusses information retrieval: specifically, the case where the query is a long text document and relevant documents must be selected from a collection of long text documents. Approaches for accomplishing this task will be reviewed, including bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and neural network-based solutions. Practical considerations for implementation will also be discussed.</li>

In this talk, Satanjeev will present one of the largest applications of ML at Twitter: ranking the main feed of Tweets by the relevance of the Tweets to the viewer. He will present the dimensions of the ML problem: the goals, the metrics to optimize for, the features they use, and the network architecture they have developed. The talk will focus on the practical application of ML, and lessons learned delivering ML-based products to millions of users every day.</li>

                        <li>Classes of computational problems remain difficult or unsolved despite the incredible gains in hardware capability described by Moore's law. With CMOS scaling approaching its apex, what are the potential future technologies that could continue driving performance improvements and even solve some intractable problems? In this talk, Mark will explore both biologically-inspired technology and quantum technology as two new non-Von Neumann computational paradigms that offer promise to expand the frontiers of computation. Machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, are, at their core, based on decades-old ideas inspired by neuroscience. Some previously unsolved problems have been cracked, but even deep learning research seems to be reaching the point of diminishing returns. After a brief overview of the key breakthroughs, Mark will point to some features that, if understood, may yield new inspiration to advance our algorithms toward more powerful ones.</li>

                        <li>Accurate statistics on human rights abuses are essential for supporting evidence-based policy, measuring progress, and raising awareness in the general public. In this talk, Neil Marchant will discuss unsupervised Bayesian entity resolution models, which are able to identify duplicate records in the data, while quantifying uncertainty. He will highlight the importance of choosing flexible priors and in implementing scalable inference algorithms, and will present preliminary results on synthetic data and a data set containing death records from the Salvadoran Civil War. Neil is a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne, Australia.</li>

                        <li>Multiple finance organizations within Microsoft rely on having accurate financial forecasts for critical business decisions. One such organization, the Enterprise Partner Group, serves some of the largest commercial and public sector organizations across the globe, with total product revenue in the range of billions of dollars worldwide. Generating up-to-date, accurate predictions with manual forecast methods can be challenging; Microsoft Finance sought a solution that can rely on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. In this talk, Amita Gajewar will explain revenue forecasting models that she developed to forecast quarterly revenue for enterprise products in several regions across the globe and their world-wide aggregate. Amita is a senior data scientist in the Cloud + AI group at Microsoft. Previously, she has worked on various projects in computational advertising at Microsoft and Yahoo!.

                        <li>Emotions play an important role in our everyday lives. They influence memory, decision-making, and well-being. In order to advance the fundamental understanding of human emotions, build smarter affective technology, and ultimately help people, we need to perform research in-situ. Leveraging exciting advances in machine learning, it is now possible to quantify emotional responses on a large scale using webcams and microphones in everyday environments. This talk describes novel methods for physiological and behavioral measurement via ubiquitous hardware, including state-of-the-art approaches for emotion synthesis that can be used to create rich human-agent or robot interactions. Dr. Daniel McDuff is a researcher at Microsoft Research, where he leads research and development of affective computing technology, with a focus on scalable tools to enable the automated recognition and analysis of emotions and physiology. Daniel completed his Ph.D. in the Affective Computing Group at the MIT Media Lab in 2014 and has a B.A. and Masters from Cambridge University.</li>

                        <li>Algorithmic composition of music has a long history, and with the development of powerful deep learning methods, there has recently been increased interest in exploring algorithms and models to create art. We explore the utility of state space models, in particular, hidden Markov models, in composing classical piano pieces. Anna Yanchenko is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke. She is interested in machine learning for time series applications, especially with applications to modeling music.</li>

                        <li>Neural network based approaches have achieved state-of-the-art results on many benchmark natural language processing tasks. These approaches rely on the representation of words as vectors, also called word embeddings. In this talk, different approaches for the creation of word embeddings will be discussed, as well as popular models for generating these embeddings like Word2Vec, ELMo, and others. John Bralich is currently a data scientist at Infinia ML. Prior to this, he worked for a Durham based startup as a machine learning engineer.

                        <li>Over the past decade, Carnegie Mellon University has scraped and indexed billions of online escort advertisements for the purpose of policing human trafficking. The huge volume and complexity of data makes it impossible for law enforcement officers to manually digest. In this talk, Matt will reveal how he used a suite of machine learning tools, including deep learning, natural language processing, record linkage, and massively scalable hashing techniques, to provide human trafficking advertisement search, analysis, and prediction capabilities to dozens of law enforcement agencies across the country. Matt received his M.S. in Robotics and is currently pursuing his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, where he studies foundational machine learning, including clustering and detecting bias in groups of data.</li>
