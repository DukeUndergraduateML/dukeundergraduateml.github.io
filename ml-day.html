								<li><b>Kat Gorman: What We Think We Talk About When We Talk About AI </b></li>
											<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'> In this open discussion we'll talk about why we see the hype, both positive and negative, around Artificial Intelligence in the public conversation and how we can help to promote the reality of research when talking to everyone from practitioners to luddites. </li>

								<li><b>Kyle Bradbury:  Machine Learning in Under 1 Hour</b></li>
                                			<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Have you ever wondered what machine learning is and what it can do? In this session, we will walk through the foundational concepts of machine learning and the three main branches: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Through a series of examples, we’ll discuss the key elements of machine learning problems, what are the common challenges that are faced, and share some pathways for beginning or deepening your knowledge of this rapidly advancing field.</li>

                                				<li><b>Josh Jelin: Preparing for Industry (Workshop)</b></li>
								<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>Speaker: Josh Jelin, Senior Product Analyst (Data Science), Google Core Systems (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jelin/">LinkedIn</a>) <br>

As a senior data scientist at Google, Josh has conducted over 50 interviews. In this session, he'll talk you through the things he looks for in interviews for data scientists of all types. Learn about the different types of data science roles that exist in industry, and how to prepare to interview for each one. Then, Josh will walk you through a technical case interview, so that you can see behind the curtain, and know exactly what interviewers are looking for when they ask questions. Make sure to bring questions of your own for the Q&A session!</li>

								<li><b>Project Phoenix: Project Spotlights</b></li>
                                			<li style='margin-bottom: 1em'>The Phoenix Project is a program put on this summer by the Duke Applied Machine Learning Group that has connected over 200 students to companies to provide real experience to replace internships. We are working with companies ranging from Duke student led startups to Walmart in Software Engineering, Data Science, ML, and Business.
