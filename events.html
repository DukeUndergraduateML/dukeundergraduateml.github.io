						<li><b>Thursday, February 7, 2019:</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/602549816840178/" target="_blank">MLBytes + Tresata: Fundamentals of Distributed Machine Learning, Koert Kuipers</a></li>
						<li><i>Ahmadieh Family Grand Hall (Gross Hall 330), 4.30pm-5.30pm</i></li>
						<li>Koert is the Chief Technology Officer of Tresata, an analytics software company and unicorn startup. Within Tresata, he leads the development of the core distributed data processing, analytics, and machine learning platform. This talk will explore the building blocks of distributed machine learning, including modern distributed platforms, the transformations they provide, and how they can be used to efficiently implement highly scalable machine learning algorithms. This is useful for data scientists that do not plan to implement algorithms themselves, as it gives them a sense of the performance of algorithms on these platforms.</li>

						<li><b>Thursday, November 15, 2018:</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/356335445106841/" target="_blank">MLBytes: Classification and Topology, Olivier Binette</a></li>
						<li><i>Ahmadieh Family Grand Hall (Gross Hall 330), 4.30pm-5.30pm</i></li>
						<li>Mathematicians of the 20th century developed topology as a tool to study qualitative properties of shapes and surfaces. This talk will introduce some of their ideas and show how they can be used to gain useful insight in binary classification. Following classical theorems, we will obtain a "topologically accurate" reconstruction of class boundaries and hint towards current research. Olivier Binette is a M.Sc. student at Université du Québec à Montréal.</li>

						<li><b>Friday, November 2, 2018:</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/891639581226825/" target="_blank">MLBytes: Addressing Human Trafficking with Machine Learning, Matthew Barnes</a></li>
						<li><i>Ahmadieh Family Grand Hall (Gross Hall 330), 12pm-1pm</i></li>
						<li>Over the past decade, Carnegie Mellon University has scraped and indexed billions of online escort advertisements for the purpose of policing human trafficking. The huge volume and complexity of data makes it impossible for law enforcement officers to manually digest. In this talk, Matt will reveal how he used a suite of machine learning tools, including deep learning, natural language processing, record linkage, and massively scalable hashing techniques, to provide human trafficking advertisement search, analysis, and prediction capabilities to dozens of law enforcement agencies across the country. Matt received his M.S. in Robotics and is currently pursuing his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, where he studies foundational machine learning, including clustering and detecting bias in groups of data.</li>

						<li><b>Saturday, October 27, 2018:</b> <a href="datathon/index.html">Duke Datathon</a></li>
						<li>Duke's datathon. Attack a dataset and come up with an analysis and visualization while racing against the clock. Top teams will win prizes, and all students will have the opportunity to interact with industry and academic sponsors.</li>

						<li><b>Thursday, October 25, 2018:</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/238338206813047/" target="_blank">MLBytes + Infinia ML: Real-time Object Detection, Dr. Ikenna Odinaka</a></li>
						<li><i>Ahmadieh Family Grand Hall (Gross Hall 330), 4.30pm-5.30pm</i></li>
						<li>YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system that can be used to determine the positions of over 9000 types of objects in images. In this exciting computer vision talk by Dr. Ikenna Odinaka, we'll explore the architecture and techniques behind the state-of-the-art YOLO algorithm. Dr. Odinaka is a data scientist at Infinia ML, and previously studied Electrical Engineering at Duke University and Washington University in St. Louis.</li>

						<li><b>Thursday, October 18, 2018:</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/232732280729130/" target="_blank">MLBytes + Infinia ML: Visual Dialog, Dr. Justin Ellis</a></li>
						<li><i>Ahmadieh Family Grand Hall (Gross Hall 330), 4.30pm-5.30pm</i></li>
						<li>Visual dialog is an exciting new field in AI that requires an AI agent to hold meaningful dialog with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content, combining techniques from computer vision, natural language processing, and dialog systems research. Dr. Ellis is a data scientist at Infinia ML. Before joining Infinia ML, Justin was an Einstein Postdoctoral Fellow at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and California Institute of Technology. His research focused on analysis of astrophysical data for gravitational wave detection, and he led a multi-institute team of researchers in statistical analysis and software development.</li>

						<li><b>Thursday, September 20, 2018:</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1387209314714931/" target="_blank">MLBytes: March MATHness, Dr. Tim Chartier</a></li>
						<li><i>Ahmadieh Family Grand Hall (Gross Hall 330), 4.30pm-5.30pm</i></li>
						<li>Every March, there is a lot of madness around "Who's number one?" The Division 1 NCAA men's basketball tournament, often called March Madness, begins! Millions of brackets are created in an attempt to predict the outcomes of the tournament. Who will win round by round? In this talk, we will see how research in ranking algorithms created brackets for March Madness that beat over 90% of over 8 million brackets submitted to ESPN's online tournament. Have a sport you'd like to analyze? By the end, you'll know how to create your own ranking method to answer "Who's number one?"</li>

						<li><b>Fall 2018:</b> <a href="http://shreygupta.me/teaching/fall-18/" target="_blank">Applied Machine Learning</a></li>
						<li>Take a half-credit course at Duke in machine learning, taught by co-president Shrey Gupta. The course includes learning specific machine learning concepts (classification, regression, clustering, object detection, dimensionality reduction, and evaluation of models), their historical origins, and existing and potential applications, and will be taught during the Fall 2018 semester. Register on DukeHub.</li>

						<li><b>Saturday, March 31, 2018:</b> <a href="ml-day-2018.html">Duke Machine Learning Day</a></li>
						<li>Come to Duke's first-ever Machine Learning Day, for undergraduates, on Saturday, March 31 in Gross Hall! At ML Day, you'll have the opportunity to learn about Duke's exciting machine learning research. And, if you're a student researcher in ML, you'll have the opportunity to present your work!</li>

						<li><b>Monday, March 19, 2018:</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2067552396814424/" target="_blank">Data Science at Facebook</a></li>
